# CHANGELOG

## 0.2.1 (11/30/16)

* Fixed an [obscure bug](https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-bookmarklet/issues/2) related to some browsers not rendering links that are draggable if the link includes an `h1` element.

  Apparently the right way to make an `h1` containing a link is for the `a` element to be inside of the `h1` element, not the other way around.

  The HTML generated by boot-bookmarklet that goes into `bookmarklets.html` now does it the right way, so that links should be draggable in all browsers.

## 0.2.0

* Added `external-bookmarklet` task. See README for more info.

## 0.1.1

* URL-encode the JavaScript code in the `javascript:` link tag.

## 0.1.0

* Initial release.
